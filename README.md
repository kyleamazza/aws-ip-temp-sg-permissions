# AWS Temporary IP Permissions for Security Groups
Quick-n-dirty repo that allows you to temporarily add an IP address to a declared list of security groups.

Shouldn't be dangerous, but just be warned that this won't be an actively developed repository, so any bugs/quirks may not be updated. Feel free to fork for your own use however! Sure beats typing all of this in manually/having to go into the console, IMO.

You can either clone the repo, or you can `npm install -g aws-ip-temp-permissions`, and then use it from the command line.
